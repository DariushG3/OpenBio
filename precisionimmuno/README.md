# Proposed pFDA Precision Immunology App-a-thon!

## Challenge: Come up with sensitive, specific and reproducible best-practice pipelines for precision treatment of infectious disease using betacoronaviruses as a test case!

### Logistics: Appathon will run from July 15 - August 15 ? (may change due to data availability)

## Challenge Modules -- (potential sponsors): 

### Clustering of RNAseq data 
* Virus response
* Drug response
* Predicted drug response
* Looking at overlaps of pathway analysis
* Overlaps of drug prediction

### Risk factors -- HLA typing 
* Predict which drugs are most effective with HLA types
* “Closing the triangle between RNAseq and HLA”
* HISAT2-genotype
* Hlacovid19.org
* Bethematch has a barcoding system for HLA types
* Simple for clinical use

### BCR typing for CoVID19
* scRNA sequencing, ala: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20039362v2.full.pdf

### TCR typing for CoVID 
* Obvious clinical applicability
* https://b-t.cr/t/publicly-available-covid-19-airr-seq-data-sets/849
* Ig (e.g. IgH) typing for coronaviruses
* EMR integration -- OHDSI (individual consortium members are in)
* OMOP compliant formatting
